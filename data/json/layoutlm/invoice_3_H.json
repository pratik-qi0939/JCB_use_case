    "summary": "The provided text contains very fragmented and unclear information, making it difficult to extract standard invoice details. Key elements identified include 'RUBBERS' (possibly a vendor name), 'UNREGISTERED.' (indicating registration status), '0002900' (a possible reference or document ID), and 'Gredit' (possibly 'Credit'). No invoice number, date, specific line items, or monetary amounts are present.",
    "approval_status": "Rejected",
    "reasoning": "The invoice is rejected because there is no clear indication of GST applied on the invoice, nor is a valid GSTIN number present; the text explicitly states 'UNREGISTERED.'. Without these crucial tax details and comprehensive invoice information, the document cannot be approved as a valid invoice."
